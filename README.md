# REST_API_CRUD_DEMO
It is a simple CRUD demo with DJANGO REST API with the help of viewsets and HyperlinkedModelSerializer which is about programming languages and its paradigm.

Technologies used :- DJANGO , REST framework , APIs , Python , SQLITE3 

project :- api_crud    
application :- languages

It handles CRUD about listing , creating , updating and deleting instances which contains name and paradigm(type) of programming languages.

It is created with viewsets of django rest framework. 
I used HyperlinkedModelSerializer to show the path(url) of individual component on rest api framework by clicking on which we can go through particular element.
